Hi! I’m **Hao-Tang Tsui**, feel free to call me Henry! 

I work on computer vision, vision–language models, and trying to build a usable bridge between pixels and words.
I’m currently a **Master’s student in Computer Vision** at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working with Prof. **[Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/)** on vision–language benchmarking.

Previously, I was a **research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html)** (YOLO-Lab) with Prof. **[Mark Liao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_IXt8boAAAAJ)**, where I worked on YOLO-related research and re-release **[YOLO](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/YOLO)** under the MIT license. I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from **[National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index)**, collaborating with Prof. **[Hong-Han Shuai](https://basiclab.lab.nycu.edu.tw/)** and Prof. **[Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~wenhuang/)**. 

I enjoy turning research ideas into clean code, benchmarks, and occasionally opinions—ideally ones that connect vision and language a little better than before.
