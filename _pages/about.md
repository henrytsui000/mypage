Hi there! I'm `Hao-Tang Tsui`, but feel free to call me Henry! 
I'm deeply passionate about computer vision and constantly exploring new ways to push its boundaries. 

Currently, I'm a full-time research assistant at the YOLO-Lab of [Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html), working under the guidance of Professor [Mark Liao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_IXt8boAAAAJ), where I'm focusing on YOLO-related [research](https://github.com/henrytsui000/yolov_rd) and re-releasing [YOLO](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/YOLO) under the MIT license.

I recently earned my degree in electrical engineering from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index), where I had the opportunity to work as a student researcher with Professors [Hong-Han Shuai](https://basiclab.lab.nycu.edu.tw/) and [Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~wenhuang/) on exciting projects. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of AI and computer vision!
